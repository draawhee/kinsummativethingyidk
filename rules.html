          <h2>Rules & Ethics</h2>
          
          <details>
              <summary><strong>Law 1</strong>: The Field of Play</summary>
            
              <p><u>1.1 Field Surface</u></p>
              <p>The field of play must be a wholly natural or, if competition rules permit, a wholly artificial playing surface except where competition rules allow a hybrid system (integrated combination of artificial and natural materials). The colour of artificial surfaces must be green.</p>
              <p>For international matches or competitions involving FIFA-affiliated national teams or clubs, artificial surfaces must meet the requirements of the FIFA Quality Programme for Football Turf, unless The IFAB grants special dispensation.</p>
            
              <p><u>1.2 Field Markings</u></p>
              <p>The field must be rectangular and marked with continuous lines, which must not be dangerous. Artificial surface material may be used for markings on natural fields if it is not hazardous. These lines belong to the areas they define.</p>
              <p>Only lines described in Law 1 may appear on the field. On artificial fields, other lines are allowed if they are a different colour and clearly distinguishable from football markings.</p>
              <p>The two longer boundary lines are touchlines; the two shorter are goal lines. The halfway line divides the field into two halves and includes the centre mark, which has a 9.15 m (10 yds) radius circle around it. Marks 9.15 m from the corner arc may also be added off the field.</p>
              <p>All lines must be the same width (max. 12 cm or 5 ins). Goal lines must be as wide as the goalposts and crossbar. Measurements are taken from the outside of lines.</p>
              <p>Unauthorised field markings by players will result in a caution for unsporting behaviour.</p>
            
              <p><u>1.3 Dimensions</u></p>
              <p>Touchline: 90–120 m (100–130 yds)<br>
              Goal line: 45–90 m (50–100 yds)</p>
              <p>Competitions may fix dimensions within these limits.</p>
            
              <p><u>1.4 Dimensions for International Matches</u></p>
              <p>Touchline: 100–110 m (110–120 yds)<br>
              Goal line: 64–75 m (70–80 yds)</p>
              <p>Competitions may determine dimensions within these limits.</p>
            
              <p><u>1.5 The Goal Area</u></p>
              <p>Two lines are drawn at right angles to the goal line, 5.5 m (6 yds) from the inside of each goalpost. They extend 5.5 m (6 yds) into the field and are joined by a line parallel to the goal line.</p>
            
              <p><u>1.6 The Penalty Area</u></p>
              <p>Two lines are drawn 16.5 m (18 yds) from each goalpost at right angles to the goal line, extending 16.5 m into the field, joined by a line parallel to the goal line.</p>
              <p>Within the penalty area: the penalty mark is 11 m (12 yds) from the midpoint between the posts. A 9.15 m (10 yds) arc is drawn outside the penalty area from this mark.</p>
            
              <p><u>1.7 The Corner Area</u></p>
              <p>Defined by a quarter-circle with a 1 m (1 yd) radius from each corner flagpost inside the field.</p>
            
              <p><u>1.8 Flagposts</u></p>
              <p>A flagpost at least 1.5 m (5 ft) high with a non-pointed top and flag is required at each corner. Additional flagposts may be placed at halfway line ends, at least 1 m (1 yd) outside the touchline.</p>
            
              <p><u>1.9 The Technical Area</u></p>
              <p>Only used in stadiums with designated seating for team officials and substitutes. The area extends 1 m (1 yd) beyond each end of the seated area and 1 m from the touchline. Markings should define the space.</p>
              <p>Occupants must be identified, behave responsibly, and stay within the area except in specific cases (e.g., medical assessment). Only one person may give tactical instructions at a time.</p>
            
              <p><u>1.10 Goals</u></p>
              <p>Placed at the centre of each goal line, goals consist of two vertical posts joined by a crossbar. They must be the same shape (square, round, elliptical, etc.), white, and made of safe materials. Internal post distance is 7.32 m (8 yds); crossbar height is 2.44 m (8 ft).</p>
              <p>Goalposts and crossbars must not exceed 12 cm (5 ins) in width or depth. If broken, play is stopped until repair. Flexible or unsafe materials are not permitted.</p>
              <p>Goals must be anchored securely. Nets may be used if they do not interfere with play.</p>
            
              <p><u>1.11 Goal Line Technology (GLT)</u></p>
              <p>GLT may be used to determine if a goal was scored. It must be stated in competition rules and comply with the FIFA Quality Programme.</p>
              <p>Only referees receive the signal (within one second) via watch or earpiece. Referees must test GLT before matches. If the system fails, it must not be used and authorities must be notified.</p>
            
              <p><u>1.12 Commercial Advertising</u></p>
              <p>Advertising is prohibited on the field, inside goal net areas, technical areas, or within 1 m (1 yd) of boundary lines during the match period. No equipment may be attached to goals, nets, or flags.</p>
              <p>Upright ads must be at least 1 m from touchlines, goal lines (net depth), and the goal net.</p>
            
              <p><u>1.13 Logos and Emblems</u></p>
              <p>Logos or emblems (real or virtual) of FIFA, associations, competitions, or clubs are not allowed on the field, nets, goals, or flagposts during play. Flags may contain logos.</p>
            
              <p><u>1.14 Video Assistant Referees (VARs)</u></p>
              <p>VAR matches require a Video Operation Room (VOR) and at least one Referee Review Area (RRA).</p>
              <p>The VOR houses VAR, AVAR, and RO, located in or near the stadium or remotely. Only authorised personnel may enter or communicate with officials there. Unauthorized entry results in a sending-off.</p>
              <p>The RRA is a visible, marked area outside the field where referees conduct on-field reviews. Unauthorized entry by players or staff results in a caution.</p>

              <summary><strong>Law 2</strong>: The Ball</summary>
            
              <p><u>2.1 Qualities and measurements</u></p>
              <p>All balls must be:
                <ul>
                  <li>spherical</li>
                  <li>made of suitable material</li>
                  <li>of a circumference of between 68 cm (27 ins) and 70 cm (28 ins)</li>
                  <li>between 410 g (14 oz) and 450 g (16 oz) in weight at the start of the match</li>
                  <li>of a pressure equal to 0.6–1.1 atmosphere (600–1,100 g/cm²) at sea level (8.5–15.6 lbs/sq in)</li>
                </ul>
                All balls used in matches played in an official competition organised under the auspices of FIFA or confederations must meet the requirements and bear one of the marks of the FIFA Quality Programme for Footballs.<br>
                Each mark indicates that the ball has been officially tested and meets the specific technical requirements for that mark, which are additional to the minimum specifications stipulated in Law 2 and must be approved by The IFAB.<br>
                National FA competitions may require the use of balls bearing one of these marks.<br>
                In matches played in an official competition organised under the auspices of FIFA, confederations or national FAs, no form of commercial advertising is permitted on the ball, except for the logo/emblem of the competition, the competition organiser and the authorised manufacturer’s trademark. The competition regulations may restrict the size and number of such markings.
              </p>
            
              <p><u>2.2 Replacement of a defective ball</u></p>
              <p>
                If the ball becomes defective:
                <ul>
                  <li>play is stopped and</li>
                  <li>restarted with a dropped ball</li>
                </ul>
                If the ball becomes defective at a kick-off, goal kick, corner kick, free kick, penalty kick or throw-in, the restart is retaken.<br>
                If the ball becomes defective during a penalty kick or penalties (penalty shoot-out) as it moves forward and before it touches a player, crossbar or goalposts, the penalty kick is retaken.<br>
                The ball may not be changed during the match without the referee’s permission.
              </p>
            
              <p><u>2.3 Additional balls</u></p>
              <p>
                Additional balls which meet the requirements of Law 2 may be placed around the field of play and their use is under the referee’s control.

          <details>
            <summary><strong>Law 16</strong>: The Penalty Kick</summary>
            <p><u>Introduction</u></p>
            <p>A goal kick is awarded when the whole of the ball passes over the goal line, on the ground or in the air, having last touched a player of the attacking team, and a goal is not scored.
            A goal may be scored directly from a goal kick, but only against the opposing team; if the ball directly enters the kicker’s goal, a corner kick is awarded to the opponents.</p>
            <p><u>16.1 Procedure</u></p>
            <p>The ball must be stationary and is kicked from any point within the goal area by a player of the defending team
            The ball is in play when it is kicked and clearly moves
            Opponents must be outside the penalty area until the ball is in play</p>
            <p><u>16.2 Offences and sanctions</u></p>
            <p>If, after the ball is in play, the kicker touches the ball again before it has touched another player, an indirect free kick is awarded; if the kicker commits a handball offence:
            a direct free kick is awarded
            a penalty kick is awarded if the offence occurred inside the kicker’s penalty area, unless the kicker was the goalkeeper, in which case an indirect free kick is awarded
            If, when a goal kick is taken, any opponents are inside the penalty area because they did not have time to leave, the referee allows play to continue. If an opponent who is in the penalty area when the goal kick is taken, or enters the penalty area before the ball is in play, touches or challenges for the ball before it is in play, the goal kick is retaken.
            If a player enters the penalty area before the ball is in play and fouls or is fouled by an opponent, the goal kick is retaken and the offender may be cautioned or sent off, depending on the offence.
            For any other offence, the kick is retaken.</p>
          </details>  
          <details>
            <summary><strong>Law 17</strong>: The Penalty Kick</summary>
            <p><u>Introduction</u></p>
            <p>A corner kick is awarded when the whole of the ball passes over the goal line, on the ground or in the air, having last touched a player of the defending team, and a goal is not scored.
            A goal may be scored directly from a corner kick, but only against the opposing team; if the ball directly enters the kicker’s goal, a corner kick is awarded to the opponents.</p>
            <p><u>17.1 Procedure</u></p>
            <p>The ball must be placed in the corner area nearest to the point where the ball passed over the goal line
            The ball must be stationary and is kicked by a player of the attacking team
            The ball is in play when it is kicked and clearly moves; it does not need to leave the corner area
            The corner flagpost must not be moved
            Opponents must remain at least 9.15 m (10 yds) from the corner arc until the ball is in play</p>
            <p><u>17.2 Offences and sanctions</u></p>
            <p>If, after the ball is in play, the kicker touches the ball again before it has touched another player, an indirect free kick is awarded; if the kicker commits a handball offence:
            a direct free kick is awarded
            a penalty kick is awarded if the offence occurred inside the kicker’s penalty area, unless the kicker was the goalkeeper, in which case an indirect free kick is awarded
            If a player, while correctly taking a corner kick, deliberately kicks the ball at an opponent in order to play the ball again but not in a careless or reckless manner or using excessive force, the referee allows play to continue.
            For any other offence, the kick is retaken.</p>
