            <summary><strong>Law 16</strong>: The Penalty Kick</summary>
            <p><u>Introduction</u></p>
            <p>A goal kick is awarded when the whole of the ball passes over the goal line, on the ground or in the air, having last touched a player of the attacking team, and a goal is not scored.
            A goal may be scored directly from a goal kick, but only against the opposing team; if the ball directly enters the kicker’s goal, a corner kick is awarded to the opponents.</p>
            <p><u>16.1 Procedure</u></p>
            <p>The ball must be stationary and is kicked from any point within the goal area by a player of the defending team
            The ball is in play when it is kicked and clearly moves
            Opponents must be outside the penalty area until the ball is in play</p>
            <p><u>16.2 Offences and sanctions</u></p>
            <p>If, after the ball is in play, the kicker touches the ball again before it has touched another player, an indirect free kick is awarded; if the kicker commits a handball offence:
            a direct free kick is awarded
            a penalty kick is awarded if the offence occurred inside the kicker’s penalty area, unless the kicker was the goalkeeper, in which case an indirect free kick is awarded
            If, when a goal kick is taken, any opponents are inside the penalty area because they did not have time to leave, the referee allows play to continue. If an opponent who is in the penalty area when the goal kick is taken, or enters the penalty area before the ball is in play, touches or challenges for the ball before it is in play, the goal kick is retaken.
            If a player enters the penalty area before the ball is in play and fouls or is fouled by an opponent, the goal kick is retaken and the offender may be cautioned or sent off, depending on the offence.
            For any other offence, the kick is retaken.</p>
          </details>  
          <details>
            <summary><strong>Law 17</strong>: The Penalty Kick</summary>
            <p><u>Introduction</u></p>
            <p>A corner kick is awarded when the whole of the ball passes over the goal line, on the ground or in the air, having last touched a player of the defending team, and a goal is not scored.
            A goal may be scored directly from a corner kick, but only against the opposing team; if the ball directly enters the kicker’s goal, a corner kick is awarded to the opponents.</p>
            <p><u>17.1 Procedure</u></p>
            <p>The ball must be placed in the corner area nearest to the point where the ball passed over the goal line
            The ball must be stationary and is kicked by a player of the attacking team
            The ball is in play when it is kicked and clearly moves; it does not need to leave the corner area
            The corner flagpost must not be moved
            Opponents must remain at least 9.15 m (10 yds) from the corner arc until the ball is in play</p>
            <p><u>17.2 Offences and sanctions</u></p>
            <p>If, after the ball is in play, the kicker touches the ball again before it has touched another player, an indirect free kick is awarded; if the kicker commits a handball offence:
            a direct free kick is awarded
            a penalty kick is awarded if the offence occurred inside the kicker’s penalty area, unless the kicker was the goalkeeper, in which case an indirect free kick is awarded
            If a player, while correctly taking a corner kick, deliberately kicks the ball at an opponent in order to play the ball again but not in a careless or reckless manner or using excessive force, the referee allows play to continue.
            For any other offence, the kick is retaken.</p>
