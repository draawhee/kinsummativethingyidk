            <h2>Biomechanics</h2>
                <p style="margin: 20px;">Soccer is often described as a game of finesse, speed, and strategy. 
                    However, beneath the surface of every goal, sprint, or pass is a foundation of complex biomechanical principles and energy system interactions that allow athletes to perform at the highest levels. 
                    In order to understand how technology can benefit and analyze performance, we first need to explore the physiological and biomechanical processes that underpin elite soccer performance, 
                    using examples from players like Cristiano Ronaldo to illustrate key movement mechanics, force applications, and energy use in real-game scenarios.</p>

                <summary><strong>1. </strong>: Running</summary>
                <p style="margin: 20px;">Running in soccer is far more than simply propelling oneself forward. It involves a finely tuned and dynamic coordination of limbs and muscles, adapting in real time to shifting demands of speed, endurance, and rapid directional changes. The gait cycle, the fundamental unit of running, starts at the moment one foot makes ground contact and ends when that same foot lands again. This cycle is broadly divided into two primary phases: the stance phase, during which the foot remains grounded, and the swing phase, where the foot is airborne, repositioning itself for the next step.

A key distinction between running and walking lies in the absence of a double support phase during running. In walking, both feet are on the ground briefly twice per cycle, but running replaces this with a double float phase, where both feet leave the ground simultaneously. This creates periods of airborne motion, making running a more dynamic and higher-impact activity. As a player increases their running speed on the soccer field, the stance phase duration shortens, while the swing and double float phases lengthen. This allows for quicker step turnover and greater velocity—an adaptation vital in the stop-and-go nature of soccer.

Managing the forces generated during running is paramount. Upon foot strike, the body undergoes a deceleration phase where impact forces are absorbed—a critical mechanism that protects joints and muscles from damage. Subsequently, a propulsion phase generates forward acceleration, pushing the player ahead. Importantly, these forces peak not precisely at initial contact or toe-off, but during the loading response as the body’s center of mass transitions. Efficient absorption and generation of these forces are crucial to maintaining momentum and preventing injury, especially when players accelerate or decelerate suddenly during play (Novacheck, 1998).

One of the most significant biomechanical factors here is the Ground Reaction Force (GRF). This is the force exerted back on the foot by the ground during contact—equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force the foot applies downward. The magnitude and direction of GRF depend largely on the position and acceleration of the athlete’s center of mass. For optimal acceleration, a slight forward lean of the trunk and pelvic tilt is biomechanically advantageous, ensuring that the GRF vector supports forward propulsion and prevents backward falls. This explains why sprinting athletes, as well as agile soccer players, often maintain a subtle forward lean during maximal efforts (Nigg & Herzog, 2007).</p>

                <p style="margin:20px;">If we look at the following photos, we can see how the running of soccer players differs from that of tradiitional sprinters. </p>

                </figure>

                <p style="margin: 20px;">Comparing Ronaldos running style to the sprinter marks some pretty obvious differences in their technique. Ronaldos running style involves shorter, rapid strides, with his knees kept low. His arms and legs sort of flail out behind him. THe sprinter, on the other hand, 
                has a much more "refined" technique, one that you would see on track athletes. His arms and legs don't swing outside their line of movement, and both his stride length and his knee height is greater than that of Ronaldos. The thing causing this difference is the style of their respective sports.
                In soccer, there are not usually a lot of the dead straight sprints that track athletes would run. Instead, soccer players often change direction rapidly, having do accelerate and decelerate their bodys and turn quicky in different directions. By keeping his knees lower and his stride shorter, Ronaldo is 
                ensuring that should any sudden change in directyion is needed, his body is already in place to decelerate and switch direections.</p>

                <p>The running gait cycle begins and ends when the same foot contacts the ground—this is known as <strong>initial contact</strong>. From there, a cycle of phases unfolds:</p>
                
                  <pre><code>
                Stance Phase:
                  The foot is in contact with the ground, absorbing impact and preparing for propulsion.
                
                Toe Off:
                  Signals the transition from stance to swing phase, where the foot leaves the ground and prepares for the next step.
                
                Double Float Phase (unique to running):
                  Both feet are off the ground momentarily—this never happens in walking. 
                  This phase increases with speed, allowing elite players to "float" between steps, 
                  increasing stride frequency and agility.
                  </code></pre>
                
                  <p>As the speed of movement increases:</p>
                
                  <pre><code>
                - Stance time decreases
                - Swing time increases
                - Cycle time shortens
                - Double support disappears, replaced by double float
                  </code></pre>
                
                  <p>This entire process is powered predominantly by the <strong>quadriceps</strong> and <strong>gluteus maximus</strong>, responsible for the major forward propulsion.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary><strong>2. Joint Motion and Coordination</strong></summary>
            
              <p>The choreography of joint angles throughout the running cycle is remarkably precise and optimized for both efficiency and power. At the start of the stance phase, the hip is flexed approximately 50 degrees. This positioning allows for effective absorption of impact forces. As the stance progresses, the hip gradually extends, often moving into slight hyperextension (about 10 degrees) just after toe-off, which contributes significantly to propelling the body forward. During the swing phase, the hip once again flexes, reaching about 55 degrees to clear the ground efficiently before extending back to about 50 degrees in preparation for the next foot strike (Perry, 1992).

The knee joint also exhibits a dynamic and well-orchestrated pattern. At heel strike, the knee is flexed around 40 degrees, which aids in absorbing the impact. This flexion increases to roughly 60 degrees during the loading response, a key moment for shock absorption. Following this, the knee begins to extend, reducing flexion to approximately 40 degrees before toe-off, thus preparing for the propulsive phase. During mid-swing, the knee flexes dramatically to about 125 degrees. This deep flexion helps the foot clear the ground while minimizing energy expenditure. Just before heel strike, the knee extends again to around 40 degrees, positioning the foot to absorb impact efficiently.

The ankle plays a crucial role as well. Upon heel strike, it is dorsiflexed around 10 degrees. This dorsiflexion rapidly increases to roughly 25 degrees to manage the body’s weight and absorb shock. Following this, plantarflexion occurs, providing the powerful push-off that propels the body forward into the swing phase. The ankle reaches a peak plantarflexion of approximately 25 degrees during this movement cycle, allowing for smooth energy transfer and efficient propulsion (Novacheck, 1998).

Rotational movements complement the flexion and extension of joints. The lower limb undergoes medial rotation during the swing phase and maintains this position at heel strike, aiding in leg positioning and balance. The foot exhibits pronation at heel strike, which helps absorb shock and adapt to uneven playing surfaces. During mid-stance, lateral rotation begins as the swing leg moves forward, preparing the body to stabilize for the next foot strike (Perry, 1992).</p>
            
              <h4>Hip Motion</h4>
              <pre><code>
            - Begins with ~50° of flexion at heel strike.
            - Extends to 10° of hyperextension by toe-off.
            - Flexes up to 55° during late swing for the next stride.
              </code></pre>
            
              <h4>Knee Motion</h4>
              <pre><code>
            - Flexes to 40° at initial contact, then 60° during loading.
            - Extends to 40° just before toe-off.
            - During mid-swing, flexes to a peak of 125°, then preps for contact.
              </code></pre>
            
              <h4>Ankle Motion</h4>
              <pre><code>
            - Dorsiflexes to ~25° post-heel strike.
            - Transitions rapidly into plantarflexion throughout stance.
            - During swing, dorsiflexes back to ~10° for preparation.
              </code></pre>
            
              <p>Lower limb rotation also plays a role:</p>
              <pre><code>
            - Medial rotation occurs in swing and heel strike.
            - Lateral rotation begins as the swing leg passes the stance leg.
            - The foot pronates upon impact to help absorb force and maintain stability.

              <summary><strong>3. Muscle Activation Timing</strong></summary>
              <p>Timing of muscle activation is critical to smooth and efficient running mechanics. Muscles exhibit their greatest activity just before and immediately after heel strike. This period requires muscles to contract eccentrically to control impact forces and stabilize joints. Interestingly, muscle activity diminishes at toe-off, as the leg moves forward with relative ease during the swing phase.

The gluteus maximus and medius muscles are particularly active at the start of stance and toward the end of the swing phase. These muscles stabilize the hip and generate significant power for propulsion. The tensor fascia latae (TFL) shows activity both at the beginning of stance and early to mid-swing, assisting in hip abduction and flexion. The adductor magnus remains active from late stance into early swing, contributing to hip stability and controlling limb trajectory.

During the swing phase, the iliopsoas acts as the main hip flexor, activating between 35-60% of the gait cycle to facilitate the forward swing of the leg. The quadriceps contract eccentrically during the initial stance (first 10%) to control knee flexion under load. Afterward, they are relatively inactive until late swing, when they concentrically contract to extend the knee in preparation for heel strike. The medial hamstrings function to extend the hip and control knee flexion through concentric contractions during stance and swing, then act eccentrically to control knee extension late in swing.

Calf muscles, especially the gastrocnemius, activate immediately after heel strike and again during late swing, assisting in propulsion and preparing the foot for landing. The tibialis anterior (TA) shows prolonged activation throughout stance and swing—more so during running than walking—to dorsiflex the foot and prevent toe drag (Cappellini et al., 2006). This highly coordinated muscle activation ensures smooth transitions between absorption and propulsion phases, maximizing efficiency and reducing injury risk.</p>
            
              <p><strong>Key activation patterns:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Gluteus maximus & medius:</strong> Active at stance onset and late swing.</li>
                <li><strong>Tensor Fascia Latae (TFL):</strong> Mirrors glute activity and supports hip stabilization.</li>
                <li><strong>Quadriceps:</strong> Eccentrically control knee flexion early in stance, switch to concentric mode late swing to prep for contact.</li>
                <li><strong>Hamstrings:</strong> Active during early stance and throughout swing. Perform both concentric (hip extension) and eccentric (knee control) functions.</li>
                <li><strong>Gastrocnemius & Tibialis Anterior:</strong> Control foot positioning and support ankle motion. TA is more active in running (73% of cycle) compared to walking (54%).</li>
              </ul>

              <summary><strong>4. Agility and Change of Direction: The True Key to Soccer Movement</strong></summary>
              
              <p><strong>Speed vs. Agility</strong></p>
              <p>In soccer, running is more than just covering ground—it is an intricate blend of aerobic endurance, anaerobic power, and acute neuromuscular control. Players frequently alternate between periods of jogging, sprinting, and walking, interspersed with rapid accelerations and sharp changes in direction. Pure sprint speed is undoubtedly advantageous, but agility and the ability to change direction quickly and efficiently often prove more decisive in game contexts.

Elite soccer players like Cristiano Ronaldo exemplify this blend of explosive power and agility. His ability to create high impulse during rapid direction changes while sprinting at full speed highlights the importance of ankle stiffness and explosive muscle contractions in enhancing agility and performance. Greater ankle stiffness improves the storage and release of elastic energy during ground contact, allowing for quicker, more powerful movements and more efficient change of direction (Kipp & Palmieri-Smith, 2013).</p>
            
              <ul>
                <li>High ankle stiffness for better energy return</li>
                <li>Explosive muscle coordination</li>
                <li>Fine control over ground contact and body lean</li>
              </ul>
            
              <p>Ronaldo’s biomechanics show that impulse during change of direction, not just velocity, is crucial. His ability to decelerate, reorient, and explode again makes him dangerous in open play.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary><strong>5. Jumping: Vertical Power and Takeoff Dynamics</strong></summary>
                <p>Jumping—especially for headers—is a skill demanding complex biomechanical coordination. Cristiano Ronaldo’s iconic running jump for a header, reaching vertical heights over 78 cm, exemplifies how sprint momentum combined with explosive leg power achieves remarkable vertical displacement (Lees et al., 2004). In comparison, a standing jump height averages only about 44 cm, illustrating the value of horizontal speed in vertical jumping.

Muscles primarily responsible include the calves and quadriceps, generating plantarflexion and knee extension forces to propel the body upward. The arm swing adds torque and upward momentum; swinging the arms forward and upward during takeoff increases jump height and hang time (Van den Tillaar & Ettema, 2009). Detailed biomechanical analysis reveals that the force exerted during takeoff can reach up to five times the acceleration due to gravity (5g), showcasing the enormous explosive power required to execute such a jump.</p>
            
              <p><strong>Jump Biomechanics</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Running jumps can almost double jump height compared to standing jumps.</li>
                <li>Arm swing generates upward torque and lift—arms tuck then explode upward.</li>
                <li>Calves and quads provide the main propulsion; jumping from a squat position maximizes force production.</li>
                <li>Elite players can produce takeoff forces exceeding 5G, as seen in Ronaldo’s documented jumps.</li>
              </ul>
            
              <p>The Rate of Force Development (RFD) is essential. A strong eccentric wind-up followed by minimal delay (amortization) into a concentric push results in optimal jump performance.</p>

            <details>
              <summary><strong>6. Shooting and Passing Mechanics</strong></summary>
                <p>Passing and shooting are both fundamentally biomechanical actions involving coordinated muscular engagement, but they differ in force requirements and body positioning. Both require the gluteal muscles, tensor fascia latae, and hip flexors to stabilize and control leg movements, but shooting demands greater force generation.

In shooting, the non-kicking foot plants firmly to provide a stable base, enabling powerful rotation of the hips to generate torque. This rotational energy transfers through the leg in a whip-like motion, where the knee snaps forward to strike the ball with maximal force (Lees et al., 2010). The ground reaction force on the planting foot can peak at approximately 190 kg just prior to impact, indicating the immense demands on stability and force transfer.

Passing usually involves less force but requires more vertical torso positioning and a sideways approach of the foot, emphasizing hip flexion and extension rather than knee extension. This facilitates better ball control and precision, which are crucial during quick ball circulation (Lees et al., 2010).</p>
            
              <p><strong>Shooting</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Driven by a kinetic whip effect—hips initiate torque, knee whips forward, and ankle follows.</li>

                <li>Contrary to popular belief, muscle mass alone doesn’t determine shot power—coordination, momentum, and body positioning are more critical.</li>
                <li>Biomechanically efficient players create greater angular velocity, translating to stronger shots.</li>

              <summary><strong>9. Energy Systems in Soccer</strong></summary>
            
              <p><strong>Aerobic System (90% of total energy)</strong></p>
                <p>Soccer players rely heavily on both aerobic and anaerobic energy systems due to the intermittent and high-intensity nature of the game. On average, players operate at about 70% of their maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) during match play, signifying a predominant reliance on aerobic metabolism, which accounts for roughly 90% of total energy expenditure (Bangsbo et al., 2006).

Nevertheless, anaerobic energy pathways are critical during short bursts of maximal effort, such as sprints, jumps, shots, and tackles. The ATP-phosphocreatine (ATP-PCr) system supplies rapid energy for explosive actions lasting up to approximately 10 seconds, regenerating ATP without oxygen consumption. During rest or low-intensity periods, creatine phosphate stores replenish while aerobic metabolism clears accumulated metabolic byproducts.

Glycolysis supports sustained high-intensity efforts lasting a few minutes, relying heavily on muscle glycogen. During intense phases of play, blood lactate concentrations rise, indicating anaerobic glycolytic activity. Fatty acid oxidation, including muscle triglycerides and free fatty acids, supplements energy supply during prolonged activity (Bangsbo et al., 2006).

Given the fluctuating demands of the game, players must develop conditioning that supports endurance and repeated explosive efforts to maintain peak performance throughout the match.</p>
