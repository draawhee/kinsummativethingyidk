            <h2>Biomechanics</h2>
                <p style="margin: 20px;">Soccer is often described as a game of finesse, speed, and strategy. 
                    However, beneath the surface of every goal, sprint, or pass is a foundation of complex biomechanical principles and energy system interactions that allow athletes to perform at the highest levels. 
                    In order to understand how technology can benefit and analyze performance, we first need to explore the physiological and biomechanical processes that underpin elite soccer performance, 
                    using examples from players like Cristiano Ronaldo to illustrate key movement mechanics, force applications, and energy use in real-game scenarios.</p>
            <details>
                <summary><strong>1. </strong>: Running</summary>
                <p style="margin: 20px;">Running is central to soccer, but it differs significantly from recreational running or sprinting in a straight line. High-level players like Ronaldo need to constantly shift directions, accelerate, decelerate, and repeat—all in a matter of seconds.</p>

                  <p>The running gait cycle begins and ends when the same foot contacts the ground—this is known as <strong>initial contact</strong>. From there, a cycle of phases unfolds:</p>
                
                  <pre><code>
                Stance Phase:
                  The foot is in contact with the ground, absorbing impact and preparing for propulsion.
                
                Toe Off:
                  Signals the transition from stance to swing phase, where the foot leaves the ground and prepares for the next step.
                
                Double Float Phase (unique to running):
                  Both feet are off the ground momentarily—this never happens in walking. 
                  This phase increases with speed, allowing elite players to "float" between steps, 
                  increasing stride frequency and agility.
                  </code></pre>
                
                  <p>As the speed of movement increases:</p>
                
                  <pre><code>
                - Stance time decreases
                - Swing time increases
                - Cycle time shortens
                - Double support disappears, replaced by double float
                  </code></pre>
                
                  <p>This entire process is powered predominantly by the <strong>quadriceps</strong> and <strong>gluteus maximus</strong>, responsible for the major forward propulsion.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary><strong>2. Joint Motion and Coordination</strong></summary>
            
              <p>Soccer-specific movements demand synchronized joint action across the entire lower limb. Below is a breakdown of motion through each major joint during the running cycle:</p>
            
              <h4>Hip Motion</h4>
              <pre><code>
            - Begins with ~50° of flexion at heel strike.
            - Extends to 10° of hyperextension by toe-off.
            - Flexes up to 55° during late swing for the next stride.
              </code></pre>
            
              <h4>Knee Motion</h4>
              <pre><code>
            - Flexes to 40° at initial contact, then 60° during loading.
            - Extends to 40° just before toe-off.
            - During mid-swing, flexes to a peak of 125°, then preps for contact.
              </code></pre>
            
              <h4>Ankle Motion</h4>
              <pre><code>
            - Dorsiflexes to ~25° post-heel strike.
            - Transitions rapidly into plantarflexion throughout stance.
            - During swing, dorsiflexes back to ~10° for preparation.
              </code></pre>
            
              <p>Lower limb rotation also plays a role:</p>
              <pre><code>
            - Medial rotation occurs in swing and heel strike.
            - Lateral rotation begins as the swing leg passes the stance leg.
            - The foot pronates upon impact to help absorb force and maintain stability.
              </code></pre>

            <details>
              <summary><strong>3. Muscle Activation Timing</strong></summary>
              <p>Unlike walking, in running—and especially soccer—the most intense muscle activity occurs just before and after heel strike, a critical window for shock absorption and propulsion.</p>
            
              <p><strong>Key activation patterns:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Gluteus maximus & medius:</strong> Active at stance onset and late swing.</li>
                <li><strong>Tensor Fascia Latae (TFL):</strong> Mirrors glute activity and supports hip stabilization.</li>
                <li><strong>Quadriceps:</strong> Eccentrically control knee flexion early in stance, switch to concentric mode late swing to prep for contact.</li>
                <li><strong>Hamstrings:</strong> Active during early stance and throughout swing. Perform both concentric (hip extension) and eccentric (knee control) functions.</li>
                <li><strong>Gastrocnemius & Tibialis Anterior:</strong> Control foot positioning and support ankle motion. TA is more active in running (73% of cycle) compared to walking (54%).</li>
              </ul>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary><strong>4. Agility and Change of Direction: The True Key to Soccer Movement</strong></summary>
              
              <p><strong>Speed vs. Agility</strong></p>
              <p>While top-end speed is valuable (and players like Ronaldo showcase elite sprinting ability), agility—the ability to change direction quickly—is more important in gameplay. This requires:</p>
            
              <ul>
                <li>High ankle stiffness for better energy return</li>
                <li>Explosive muscle coordination</li>
                <li>Fine control over ground contact and body lean</li>
              </ul>
            
              <p>Ronaldo’s biomechanics show that impulse during change of direction, not just velocity, is crucial. His ability to decelerate, reorient, and explode again makes him dangerous in open play.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary><strong>5. Jumping: Vertical Power and Takeoff Dynamics</strong></summary>
            
              <p><strong>Jump Biomechanics</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Running jumps can almost double jump height compared to standing jumps.</li>
                <li>Arm swing generates upward torque and lift—arms tuck then explode upward.</li>
                <li>Calves and quads provide the main propulsion; jumping from a squat position maximizes force production.</li>
                <li>Elite players can produce takeoff forces exceeding 5G, as seen in Ronaldo’s documented jumps.</li>
              </ul>
            
              <p>The Rate of Force Development (RFD) is essential. A strong eccentric wind-up followed by minimal delay (amortization) into a concentric push results in optimal jump performance.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary><strong>6. Shooting and Passing Mechanics</strong></summary>
            
              <p><strong>Shooting</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Driven by a kinetic whip effect—hips initiate torque, knee whips forward, and ankle follows.</li>
                <li>Plant foot absorbs 30 stone (~190 kg) of force at impact.</li>
                <li>Contrary to popular belief, muscle mass alone doesn’t determine shot power—coordination, momentum, and body positioning are more critical.</li>
                <li>Biomechanically efficient players create greater angular velocity, translating to stronger shots.</li>
              </ul>
            
              <p><strong>Passing</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Uses similar mechanics as shooting but with reduced power and more precision.</li>
                <li>The body stays more upright, and the leg swing is less exaggerated.</li>
                <li>Hip flexors and extensors play a larger role than quads.</li>
              </ul>
            </details>

            <details>
              <summary><strong>7. Touch and Ball Control</strong></summary>
              <ul>
                <li>Elite players “absorb” the ball's momentum using relaxed muscles and slight retractions.</li>
                <li>Hip flexibility and fine motor control allow precise adjustments based on the ball’s angle and speed.</li>
                <li>Maintaining balance while adjusting center of mass is essential—Ronaldo’s ability to deaden or redirect fast balls showcases high-level proprioception.</li>
              </ul>
            </details>
            
            <details>
              <summary><strong>8. Goalkeeping and Reaction Dynamics</strong></summary>
              <ul>
                <li>Goalkeeper dives require similar mechanics as jumping, with added upper limb swing and body control.</li>
                <li>Explosive lateral movement, often driven by a sudden arm motion or core torque.</li>
                <li>Use of ATP-PC system for rapid, high-intensity movements.</li>
              </ul>
            </details>
            
            <details>
              <summary><strong>9. Energy Systems in Soccer</strong></summary>
            
              <p><strong>Aerobic System (90% of total energy)</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Supports ongoing movement, recovery, and repeated efforts.</li>
                <li>Average work rate during games: ~70% VO2 max.</li>
              </ul>
            
              <p><strong>Anaerobic System</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Activated during sprints, jumps, and shots.</li>
                <li>ATP-PC system handles explosive bursts lasting under 10 seconds.</li>
                <li>Glycolysis kicks in for sustained efforts, leading to lactate buildup.</li>
                <li>Energy restoration occurs during match pauses (e.g., fouls, throw-ins).</li>
              </ul>
            
              <p><strong>Observed Trends</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Blood lactate levels reach 10+ mM during intense match phases.</li>
                <li>Glycogen is the primary substrate, but fatty acids and glucose also contribute to oxidative metabolism.</li>
              </ul>
            </details>

            <p>The biomechanics of soccer are far more than just impressive goals and quick footwork. Every sprint, jump, shot, and pass involves coordinated efforts of joints, muscles, and energy systems. Players like Cristiano Ronaldo highlight the integration of elite physiology with technical mastery. From arm-driven vertical leaps to subtle shifts in center of mass during a dribble, soccer remains a sport where science meets art on every blade of grass.</p>
