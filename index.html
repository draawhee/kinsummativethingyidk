            <p style="margin: 20px;">
                Around the world, football (or soccer in North America), is played by more than 240 million people, a statistic generated by the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). The number of fans around the world can be doubled, with the 2022 World Cup opening match and finals having a worldwide total of 550 million viewers and 1.5 billion viewers respectively.

            <p style="margin: 20px;">
                Although organized association football only became a thing in the 19th century, the origins of the game can be seen more than 2000 years ago, in ancient civilizations such as China, Greece, and Rome, where the balls were made of rock or stuffed animal hides. There's even evidence that shows similar games being played in older Mesoamerican cultures.

            <p style="margin: 20px;">
                The Football Association (FA) was created in 1863, in England, and an initial ruleset and dimensions of the matchball were standardized, although these rules are still changing to this day. The biggest change was banning carrying the ball with your hands, separating association football and rugby. WIth the creation of the FA, more teams started to join and play with the fixed rules, and a round ball and 11 players per team were mandated, and a top was added to the nets.

            <p style="margin: 20px;">
                By the 20th century, football had spread all across Europe rather than just the British territories, leading to more conflict with international play. In 1904, FA representatives from Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland formed the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA).

            <p style="margin: 20px;">
                Modern day tournaments, such as the UEFA Champions League and FIFA World Cup have existed under various names for many years.The World Cup was first held in Uruguay, in 1930. The tournament was won by, you guessed it, Uruguay. The UEFA Champions League, the largest club tournament first started in 1955. It originally called the European Champion Clubs Cup, before being renamed as the UEFA Champions league in 1992.

            <p style="margin: 20px;">
                Since the rules have remained consistent for the 100+ years they've been instated, FIFA is rather traditionalist, and are slow to implement new technologies because of this. Its only in recent years, with controversies such as Frank Lampard or Ede Dzeko's disallowed goals in the 2010 and 2014 World Cups respectively.

            <p style="margin: 20px;">The evolution of soccer over the decades has been driven not just by tactics and rules, but by the players themselves. Every era brings its own disruptors. Icons. Game-changers. Each one leaves a fingerprint on how the sport is played. Take Franz Beckenbauer, for instance—he didn’t just defend; he reinvented the role. The “sweeper” position? That was him. Before, defenders mostly cleared the ball. Simple. But Beckenbauer started running the game from the back, directing traffic like a general. Paolo Maldini? A masterclass in consistency and class. He stayed at the top for over twenty years, reading the game with terrifying calm. In midfield, Zinedine Zidane elevated the position with an effortless mix of power and grace. Technical brilliance. Ice-cold composure. Even his dramatic World Cup sendoff couldn’t tarnish the legacy. Diego Maradona was fire—unpredictable, explosive, and impossible to ignore. Skill that defied belief. Controversy that lit arguments across generations. That “Hand of God” moment? Still a sore spot—or a badge of genius—depending who you ask. Pelé was the blueprint. A global icon long before Instagram. They practically invented the word legend for him. And then came Lionel Messi. What can you even say? He dribbles like the ball is glued to his feet. Passes like he’s got eyes in the back of his head. Scores like it’s inevitable. The man plays like the game was made for him.

            These iconic players forced the sport to evolve. Coaches didn’t just adapt—they reimagined everything. Tactical systems grew sharper, more intricate, layered with ideas built around movement, possession, and space. Defenders transformed. They went from backline barriers to intelligent initiators of play. Now they read the game, pass with precision, and join the attack when needed. Midfielders became artists and engineers all at once—thanks in large part to Zidane, whose poise and vision turned control into poetry. And then there were the magicians. Maradona. Messi. Players who didn’t just play—they performed. With them came the era of flair. Around the world, kids laced up their boots and hit the pitch trying nutmegs, step-overs, flicks, feints—moves meant not just to beat defenders but to leave a mark. The game got faster, smarter, more expressive. And a whole lot more fun to watch.

            <p style="margin: 20px;">Technology as we know it has never really been implemented in football until recent times, since FIFA has typically had more "traditionalistic" views on soccer, leading to a rather slow modernization process compared to other sports leagues. In the 1980s, video analysis became more prevalent, with teams being able to review and pinpoint mistakes in their matches, causing more diverse tactics to be toyed with. 

                In 2008, GPS tracking first came on to the scene. This would revolutionize the way player performance was measured, as it allowed for heatmaps, distance covered, sprint speed, and more to be tracked and analyzed. Heatmaps in particular were crucial in helping players develop proper positioning. There have been other technological advancements to the game, such as Goal Line Technology, where high speed cameras are used to determine that the ball crossed the line and the goal should be counted.

            <p style="margin: 20px;">More recently, we’ve also seen the uptake in VAR and semi-automated offside lines. VAR, or Virtual Assistant Referee, is a group of match officials in a room viewing cameras. Cameras are placed around the stadium to capture a variety of angles. If a referee’s decision appears questionable, VAR reviews the play from multiple perspectives to determine whether the referee should revisit the call at the on-field monitor. Semi-automated offside technology, first used in the 2022 World Cup, also relies on these strategically placed cameras. An automated system detects when a player is offside and sends a signal directly to the referee’s earpiece or watch, prompting an immediate review.</p>

            <p style="margin: 20px;">Alongside the development of technology, companies have also developed improvements to equipment and the playing surface. Playing surfaces such as Astroturf and artificial grass grew in popularity as they are easier to maintain and provide a level playing surface across the whole field. Modern fields tend to be a hybrid of artificial turf and natural grass, allowing for the best playing surface available. Companies like Adida and Nike have made drastic improvements to boot quality and material, allowing for balls to almost feel stuck to your foot as you play. 

Smart balls have also been developed, where the balls have a small sensor in them, allowing them to track the speed and rotation of the ball, and while recording, even trace the flight path the ball takes. New training methods such as using VO2max or the Fifa 11+ warm up improve coaches' abilities to tailor exercises to bring the best performance out of the athlete, and reduce the risk of injury and overwork that could occur. As we take a closer look at the variety of biomechanics involved in the sport, we’ll be able to understand how injuries occur, how these technological developments help prevent injury and boost player performance, and try and see what other cool inventions might be created in the future.
