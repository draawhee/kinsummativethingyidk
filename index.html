            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><!-- Around the world, football (or soccer in North America), is played by more than 240 million people, a statistic generated by the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). The number of fans around the world can be doubled, with the 2022 World Cup opening match and finals having a worldwide total of 550 million viewers and 1.5 billion viewers respectively. SOURCE

Although organized association football only became a thing in the 19th century, the origins of the game can be seen more than 2000 years ago, in ancient civilizations such as China, Greece, and Rome, where the balls were made of rock or stuffed animal hides. There's even evidence that shows similar games being played in older Mesoamerican cultures.

The Football Association (FA) was created in 1863, in England, and an initial ruleset and dimensions of the matchball were standardized, although these rules are still changing to this day. The biggest change was banning carrying the ball with your hands, separating association football and rugby. WIth the creation of the FA, more teams started to join and play with the fixed rules, and a round ball and 11 players per team were mandated, and a top was added to the nets.

By the 1880s the general rules of the game had been standardized, but the English, Scottish, Irish, and Welsh Football associations all had conflicting rules, causing problems when it came to international play. Although impractical, the rules of the home team were used for the game. The FA’s called a meeting amongst themselves to standardize the rules. TOO MUCH INFO WE DON’T NEED- STICK TO INFO THAT IS RELEVANT TO YOUR THESIS. 

By the 20th century, football had spread all across Europe rather than just the British territories, leading to more conflict with international play. In 1904,  FA representatives from Belgium, Denmark, Franch, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland formed the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA).




Modern day tournaments, such as the UEFA Champions League and FIFA World Cup have existed under various names for many years.The World Cup was first held in Uruguay, in 1930. The tournament was won by, you guessed it, Uruguay. The UEFA Champions League, the largest club tournament, started in 1955, originally called the European Champion Clubs Cup, before becoming the champions league as we know it today.
THIS IS WHERE YOU INTRODUCE THE THESIS IDEA- while the game has had fairly consistent rules and foundational skills for 100 years, FIFA and international organizations have traditionally been extremely late adopters of the use of technology, both for analyzing play, and for helping players reach their full potential. Use the hand of God, and this video to explain how tech was forced onto the league (Sepp Blatter- dinosaur??) Frank Lampard's DISALLOWED Goal: Germany v England World Cup South Africa 2010 Last Sixteen , how tech is now being used to analyze cardiorespiratory systems to improve player health and purchasing better players, as well as reducing the risk of injury, how technology and different training methods can be used to improve the physical attributes of players that ARE purchased for a team, allowing for improved outcomes, while finally we’ll examine the motion capture and biomechanics of playing soccer, and how technology can be used to improve technique and execution and make simulations of the athletes, used for ******. CONCLUSION IS WHERE YOU SEE TECH TAKING SOCCER NEXT.


The rules are obviously WAY TOO DETAILED, but you can leave them in if you want. INFOGRAPHIC OF FIELD, with the definition of each line etc. 

                Technology as we know it has never really been implemented in football until recent times. In the 1980s, video analysis became more prevalent, with teams being able to review and pinpoint mistakes in their matches, causing more diverse tactics to be toyed with. 

In 2008, GPS tracking first came on to the scene. This would revolutionize the way player performance was measured, as it allowed for heatmaps, distance covered, sprint speed, and more to be tracked and analyzed. Heatmaps in particular were crucial in helping players develop proper positioning. There have been other technological advancements to the game, such as Goal Line Technology, where high speed cameras are used to determine that the ball crossed the line and the goal should be counted.

More recently, we’ve also seen the uptake in VAR and semi-automated offside lines. VAR, or Virtual Assistant Referee, is a group of match officials in a room viewing cameras. Cameras are placed around the stadium to gain a variety of different angles, and if a call a referee has made seems off, VAR looks at the action from every angle to determine if the referee revisit his call at the on-field monitor. 

Semi-automated offsides were first implemented in the 2022 World Cup, where again cameras are placed around the stadium, and an automated decision system determines if a player is caught offside. If that is the case, a signal will be sent to the referees earpiece or watch, notifying him of what happened.

Alongside the development of technology, companies have also developed improvements to equipment and the playing surface. Playing surfaces such as Astroturf and artificial grass grew in popularity as they are easier to maintain and provide a level playing surface across the whole field. Modern fields tend to be a hybrid of artificial turf and natural grass, allowing for the best playing surface available. Companies like Adida and Nike have made drastic improvements to boot quality and material, allowing for balls to almost feel stuck to your foot as you play. 

Smart balls have also been developed, where the balls have a small sensor in them, allowing them to track the speed and rotation of the ball, and while recording, even trace the flight path the ball takes. New training methods such as using VO2max or the Fifa 11+ warm up improve coaches' abilities to tailor exercises to bring the best performance out of the athlete, and reduce the risk of injury and overwork that could occur. As we take a closer look at the variety of biomechanics involved in the sport, we’ll be able to understand how injuries occur, and how these technological developments help prevent injury and boost player performance
